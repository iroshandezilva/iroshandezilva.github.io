                <p class="mb-10">Thanks to my self-learning I've gained enough knowledge in UI UX. I connect UX/UI
                    design with real business goals while providing delightful client experiences.</p>
                <p class="mb-10">Currently, I’m designing the next generation of note-taking experience at Craft with an
                    incredible team. Previously, I was a UI UX Designer at <a target="_blank"
                                                                              href="https://www.bhasha.lk/">Bhasha.</a>
                </p>
                <p class="mb-10">Outside of my full-time commitments, I work with a select freelance client base to
                    create amazing products and solutions.</p>
                <p class="mb-10">I’m passionate about building & designing thoughtful experiences to make sure your
                    customers and users are satisfied when they’re using your products and services

                <p class="mb-10">I also love documenting my journey and sharing it with the community to help others

                <h2 class=" text-4xl mb-10">Following my passion</h2>
                <p class="mb-10">The design has always been my passion and hobby since my early childhood. I learned to
                    design and code on my own out of curiosity.
                    This curiosity helped me to stay up-to-date from year to year and I’m still learning every single
                    day to ensure I can deliver the most modern and effective solutions. I believe in working hard and
                    smart instead of searching for “hacks and shortcuts”.</p>

                <small>Why design?</small>
                <h2 class=" text-4xl mb-10">Making people happy by making things simple</h2>
                <p class="mb-10">As technology progresses things are getting more and more complex. As a designer, I
                    have a special opportunity to make these complex processes simple, delightful, and joy to use every
                    day.</p>
                <p class="mb-10">The design allows us to differentiate ourselves by showing attention and care about our
                    customers and users. Everybody values design either consciously or unconsciously. This is why I love
                    creating thoughtful, meaningful, and polished experiences, which makes both the creators and
                    customers happy.</p>
